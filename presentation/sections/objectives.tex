	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Create a main repository for applications, where the users can browse,
	  share and retrieve them. Taking into account:
	  \begin{itemize}
	    \item Flexible sharing process: choosing rules and communities.
	    \item Application adaptation during the retrieval process.
	    \item Changes needed as transparent as possible to the user
	    \item Add a mechanism to allow searching applications: by different criteria
	    (tags, description, type, etc.) and by recommendation based on the
	    similarity with respect to a local application.
	  \end{itemize}
	  
	  \item Create a system which allows the users to tag the applications. Taking
	  into account different scopes:
	  \begin{itemize}
	    \item Private tags.
	    \item Community tags.
	    \item Public tags.
	  \end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Create a GUI which allows the user to carry out these operations.
	  Taking into account:
	  \begin{itemize}
	    \item The GUI has to be connected with the rest of systems in a loose
	    coupling way.
	    \item It has to be intuitive.
	    \item It has to be extensible, so other systems can be connected to it in
	    the future.
	  \end{itemize}
